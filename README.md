<h1>WORK IN PROGRESS!</h1>

This is Talkspace, my perhaps most ambitious project yet. A fully functioning chatroom app. 

User will be able to: 
* Join an existing room
* Create a new room
* Chat with anyone in the room
* ...

Built With:
* React
* Express
* MongoDB
* Node
* TailwindCSS

Users are prompted for a username when they enter the first time. A user can change their username whenever they want but still keep their ID. Any user can create a room and join a room. Chat is updated live. And the app is ofcourse fully responsive. Below you can see the inital design and how it turned out.
